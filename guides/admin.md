# Admin Section Usage

This guide will go over how to use the admin tab of aumt.co.nz, tab by tab.

## Trainings

### Properties

* Title - will appear as the heading on the signup form
* Opens - the date and time at which the training will appear for member signups
* Closes - the date and time at which the training will disappear from the signup tab.
* Open To Public - whether or not non-members can sign up to the training. 
    * If No, the website will require a member to sign in and have paid to view the training.
    * If Yes, the form will be open to anyone and the "Feedback" input on the form will be replaced with a "Name" field so admin has an idea who signs up
* Sessions - options for members to sign up to. There must be at least one. Each session has a title, displayed as an option on the form, and a limit for how many members can sign up. 
* Notes - any miscellaneous text for admin to put on the training form for anyone to read. Must be only text (no html, etc)

### How to Create

1. On the Admin dashboard under Trainings, click the 'Create Training' button in the top right
2. Fill in the form and click 'Save Training' to save it.

The Populate Weekly Defaults button is entirely optional to use. Select a week and it will fill in a basic training for that week with times, a title and sessions.

### How to Edit
