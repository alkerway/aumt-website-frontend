This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup
Add firebase info to a .env.production and .env.development file in the root directory for the environment variables provided by firebase:

REACT_APP_FB_API_KEY

REACT_APP_FB_AUTH_DOMAIN

REACT_APP_FB_DATABASE_URL

REACT_APP_FB_PROJECT_ID

REACT_APP_FB_STORAGE_BUCKET

REACT_APP_FB_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID

REACT_APP_FB_APP_ID

And the server url as a base for the api (e.g. http://localhost:8000 in .env.development, https://aumuaythai.com in .env.production)

REACT_APP_SERVER_API=

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
